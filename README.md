# Slideshow
An Xsession script to run a PowerPoint slideshow using LibreOffice in kiosk style. The device will boot and then automatically launch into the presentation, if slide timings are set up then these will be honoured. There is a facility to update the on-disk slideshow by using a USB stick that is inserted on boot but there are certain caveats with this. This was originally built for the Raspberry Pi single board computer but it should be possible to easily be adapt this for other devices.

# Installation instructions for running Raspberry Pi slideshow   

* Install latest Raspberry Pi OS to SD card and boot Raspberry Pi   
* Run through initial Raspi-Config and then boot into GUI   

* Update repositry info and upgrade packages to latest versions   
`sudo apt-get update`   
`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`   

* Install following applications:   
  Matchbox - Lightweight window manager    
  `sudo apt-get install matchbox`   

  rsync - File synchronisation application   
  `sudo apt-get install rsync`   

  LibreOffice - Office suite including presentation application   
  `sudo apt-get install libreoffice`   

  USBmount - Mounts usb stick automatically   
  `sudo apt-get install usbmount`   

* Fix some issues that crept in when Debian moved to the Bullseye release    
  `sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/systemd-udevd.service.d`    
  `wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jb2cool/slideshow/master/00-my-custom-mountflags.conf -O /etc/systemd/system/systemd-udevd.service.d/00-my-custom-mountflags.conf`

* Reboot (to apply new mount settings)   
  `sudo reboot`   

* Copy .xsession to /home/pi - assuming pi is the user id setup to run on bootup   
This script starts the display manager and syncs the default user home with a fresh copy from /media/usb/pi   
It also deletes any previous LibreOffice config allowing clean start of slideshow   
  `wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/jb2cool/slideshow/master/.xsession`   

* Insert the USB transfer stick (should have the label usb or you'll need to change some stuff)   

* Create a copy of the default user (pi) in /media/usb   
  `sudo cp -r /home/pi /media/usb/`   
  `cd /media/usb/pi/`   
  `sudo chmod -R a+r .`   
  `sudo chmod a+x .xsession`   

* Create a slideshow named slideshow.pps and copy to /media/usb/pi - This will autostart on bootup   
* To update the slideshow simply replace the slideshow.ppt file on the USB stick and reboot the Raspberry Pi with the USB stick plugged in (The USB stick is only needed for updating the presentation, without the USB stick it'll just play the last know presentation)   
Restart the Raspberry Pi, stand back and enjoy your show   

Thanks to Peter Milne for supplying the original code. I have only adjusted his work for my own use (primarily by assing the USB stick updating function)
